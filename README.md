# Munro — Website Image Text Extractor

Munro crawls a website, downloads all visible images, runs OCR on them, and saves the results for review, and it provides a breakdown of the entire front-end website copy. Munro is a significant time-saver for pricing website language services, expecially when text within images need to be translated.

## Features

- Crawls all linked pages from a given base URL
- Downloads image assets, skipping invalid or base64 blobs
- Uses Tesseract OCR to extract any visible text from images
- Outputs a CSV (`output/results.csv`) with detected text
- Optional script to isolate images containing text only

## Folder Structure

- `utils/` – contains the main scripts
  - `crawler.py` – crawls the site
  - `image_downloader.py` – handles image scraping
  - `ocr.py` – runs text extraction with Tesseract
- `output/` – contains downloaded images and final results
- `filter_text_images.py` – optional script to copy only images with OCR-detected text

## 🚀 How to Run
