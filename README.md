# Munro â€” Website Image Text Extractor

Munro crawls a website, downloads all visible images, runs OCR on them, and saves the results for review, and it provides a breakdown of the entire front-end website copy. Munro is a significant time-saver for pricing website language services, expecially when text within images need to be translated.

## Features

- Crawls all linked pages from a given base URL
- Downloads image assets, skipping invalid or base64 blobs
- Uses Tesseract OCR to extract any visible text from images
- Outputs a CSV (`output/results.csv`) with detected text
- Optional script to isolate images containing text only

  - `crawler.py` â€“ crawls the site
  - `image_downloader.py` â€“ handles image scraping
  - `ocr.py` â€“ runs text extraction with Tesseract
